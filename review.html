          <h1>Past, Present and the Future</h1>
          <h3>Gather Evidence from History</h3>
          <p>
            According to ancient Indian Ayurveda, food is a medicine. The
            development of western medicine appears to over shadow the basic of
            human survival mechanism; healthy food. Sadly, food and medicine are
            huge business in our times. But we can respond differently, we do
            not have to buy or eat unhealthy processed food products. Once
            healthy lifestyle is prioritized, medicine would not be required to
            treat obesity crisis.
          </p>
          <h3>Observe the Lifestyle Trends</h3>
          <p>
            We must understand the human evolution to comprehend the issues and
            challenges in our times. Advancement of science and technology
            helped us achieve greater things in life that we may not have had;
            the same progress also made us stay indoors. Once upon the time, we
            did not need exercise bikes when we were riding bicycles to work. To
            remain active and well, we are obligated to adjust our lifestyle
            according to the condition we thrive in. According to Darwin’s
            theory, adaptation is a survival instrument.
          </p>
          <h3>Listen to the Right Channels</h3>
          <p>
            Food industry is another corporate business, not a charity. They are
            not our parents who would persuade to make healthy choices. Instead,
            they will produce more of what they sell. Businesses compete to
            survive; serious ethics are bad for business. When consumers become
            health conscious and make healthy choices, businesses will follow.
            Common threat of agriculture pesticides, farm medicines and water
            pollutions are inevitable in an industrialized environment. As the
            global demand for food increases, so does the challenges from nature
            to produce the goods; therefore, blaming anyone in the chain
            eliminates the opportunity to have transparency.
          </p>

          <h3>Reality of Pesticides or Antibiotics</h3>
          <p>
            The real concern of health does not spare anyone even vegans. Use of
            antibiotics in animals are directly harmful to human health while
            lesser evil pesticides share hazardous to the environment as well as
            health. Massive growth of agriculture once promoted the idea of
            vegan diet; however, avoiding meat would mean consuming greater
            calories to meet iron and protein intake levels. Therefore, it may
            be worth paying attention to physiological responses when it comes
            to appropriate diet options. In fairness, the ideal solution is to
            consume vegetables, fruits, dairy and some meat to better serve the
            health.
          </p>

          <h3>Detrimental Impact of Processed Foods</h3>
          <p>
            Modern food processing can be defined as altering the original form
            of food in any way or shape for consumption. In the definition,
            cooking can also be viewed as processing but a method always
            practiced for centuries without harms to health among variety of
            cultures. Similarly, most foods require to be cooked at home before
            consumption such as seafood and poultry. For instance, carrot and
            celery are best to be eaten raw while sweet potato and egg are to be
            steamed. In the same way, keeping in the freezer or refrigerator is
            less harmful and an acceptable standard in modern lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the simplicity, cooking and storing at home is not to be
            confused with industrial processing through heating, cooling,
            preserving, packing and storing on shelf display. The extensive
            refining process includes variety of cleaning methods using chemical
            substances and preservatives such as fat, salt and sugars that
            significantly alters the original form of food. Potatoes are healthy
            but not potato chips. Highly processed chips are foreign objects to
            the body not food. The processing removes the natural elements of
            the potato that would connect with body which gives signals to the
            brain.
          </p>
          <h2>Market Science without Substance</h2>
          <p>
            In a free society, economic drives the system which means money
            makes the move and the rest remains. Advanced science requires
            greater resources on every corner. Unfortunately, government have
            limited funding for every category and cannot be stretched any
            further than the available capacity. Whereas, food industry can
            extend as much as needed to increase the potential. There are no
            motives to bring real science that would benefit humankind. Most of
            the astonishing scientific claims are rarely replicated nor peer
            reviewed for validation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientific studies on processed foods are least likely to come to
            the market since it would jeopardize industrial investments. Any few
            existing researches are usually hard to find and nearly invisible to
            typical consumers. However, guilt free and feel good scientific
            studies overflow public sights. Understandably, money is the
            motivator to make more money; thus, science leans toward economy
            rather than society. Among scholars, statements such as “Scientists
            are the new priests” are hard to ignore in present circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from funding and partiality, most researches are not tested on
            humans. In fact, tests are done commonly on rats in a controlled
            environment. Important reasons being ethics, regulations and cost.
            Even if the tests are done on humans, not all people have the same
            genetics, diets or lifestyles. The medicine that treat one disease
            may cause another and one person may cure while another not. Due to
            extreme variations of human genetics, diets and lifestyle,
            scientific findings are only as good as an informed prediction.
