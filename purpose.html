          <h1>Purpose of the Project</h1>
          <p>
            The objective of maintaining good health is turning out to be more
            challenging for millennials than their counterparts. Particularly in
            developed countries, the troubling trend is observed through
            intensifying health disorders among young adults living in urban
            cities. Private health experts attempt to untangle socially deprived
            lifestyle at a premium but none seem to agree with another;
            meanwhile, authorities appear muted on developing any substantial
            resolutions. The collaborative research project focused on urban
            lifestyle conditions predominantly in the cities of Montreal,
            Toronto and Vancouver.

          <p>
            The era of google brings vast amounts of information to our
            fingertips. A critical challenge is to find truthful information
            without any partiality. Ironically, most healthy diet sites also
            advertise unhealthy foods which annoys the visitors. Rest tend to
            promote a fitness product or some sort of service; which interfere
            with content validity. Nonetheless, a wide gap between fitness
            freaks and diet experts, that diet for life projects fills on behalf
            of everyday citizens.
          </p>

          <p>
            The underlying motivation was to educate community about healthier
            lifestyle choices. For the most part, lack of awareness and improper
            dietary practices appear to cause poor healthy choices in developed
            countries. With greater care and compassion, the research analysis
            translated into a practical guide to healthy lifestyle in the 21st
            century.
          </p>

          <h2>Current Issues and Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            In recent times, consumer health is under attack from every
            conceivable criteria; therefore, advanced knowledge of diet is vital
            to navigate through the social complexity of dietary.
          </p>
          <h3>Devils in the Details</h3>
          <p>
            The obesity is an epidemic problem in most developed countries.
            Health science community is on the hesitance to point out the
            obvious problem without adequate studies. When the same diet
            practice brings two different results, academics cannot formulate a
            conclusion. As the facts contradict, independent research groups are
            producing short term solutions that in favor of corporate business
            models.
          </p>
          <h3>The Secret of Good Health</h3>
          <p>
            Every diet program is subject to personal experience; nevertheless,
            weight lose supplements are discouraged due to lack of scientific
            exploration to support the results. Any attempt to answer obesity
            without understanding the problem is only as good as guesswork; not
            science. Balanced diet, rest and exercise is the key aspect to
            weight management. Respectively, less processed diet with moderate
            exercise may be a safe route to take in attempt to restore better
            health.
          </p>
          <h3>A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing</h3>
          <p>
            Any weight loss solution is a focus on getting better health through
            loosing excessive weight. Undeniably, it is a norm among young
            adults to receive weight loss supplements and surgeries in the hope
            of better health. Any such practices are unhealthy and should not
            have been a norm in the first place. Unfortunately, weight loss
            programs recommended by most health professionals have a business to
            serve on its own. Travelling the wrong path will not reach to the
            destination but not knowing which path being travelled makes it even
            worse for consumers.
          </p>
          <h3>Snake Oils and Magical Cures</h3>
          <p>
            People have fallen into the trap of losing weight for variety of
            reasons. Some believed the face value of information based on
            advertising claims and celebrity status while others were convinced
            by the bogus scientific arguments. Consumers ignore the fact that
            someone has eyes on their wallet; while, looking for quick and easy
            solutions. No wonder why so many snake oils and magical cures still
            in the market. Rather than masking the problem, it’s worth to
            investigate the real problem and address the root causes.
          </p>

          <h3>Too Many False Narratives</h3>
          <p>
            Access to information is no longer an issue in western part of the
            world; however, unbiased information is extremely hard to find.
            Every year, century old diet programs wear new costume in the
            mainstream media. Unfortunately, general public do not have any
            means to challenge the scientists in white gowns. Credibility of
            individuals, qualifications and associations often go unchecked
            under the white coat.
          </p>

          <h3>Complex Nature of Food Science</h3>
          <p>
            An expert in one subject do not have capability to make a claim that
            crosses multiple disciplines. Even collaboration of individuals do
            not help in order to produce accurate answers. Spectrum of science
            is too big to catch in a small box. At the sametime, every
            hypothesis is not worth red carpet presentation particularly when
            profit is the motivation.
