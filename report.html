          <h1>Resolution to the Dilemmas</h1>
          <h3>Bridge between Nature and Humans</h3>
          <p>
            Humans are simply creatures of the nature that supposed to live in
            harmony with all matters of the universe. Unlike plants and animals,
            humans have superior knowledge. Greater intelligence capacity also
            becomes a greater problem when humans ignore the basic rules of the
            nature. Environment consent humans to feed as desired in exchange
            for fertilizer. Eating foods in natural form keeps human body closer
            to the nature. However, processing of natural foods using variety of
            engineering methods alters conditions of the food and disrupts the
            physical connection to the nature. Therefore, the norms are violated
            when humans consume foreign diet. First, physical body suffers then
            the nature. In one way or another, extreme food processing in any
            shape is not very far from crime against humanity.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>1. I monitor my calorie intake when I eat out</li>
            <p>
              The calorie count gives us some indication of how much to eat. It
              is flawed terribly with processed foods; therefore, calorie is not
              the same as actual food source
            </p>
            <li>2. I drink fruit juice instead of soft drinks</li>
            <p>
              The nutrition of fruit juice is not the same as actual fruit. For
              an example, quality of calorie in an orange is significantly
              higher than the orange juice on the display
            </p>
            <li>3. I read ingredients before purchasing any food</li>
            <p>
              Accuracy of labelling is an ongoing battle for Canadian Food
              Agency. No preservatives are good for our health whether natural
              or artificial. Best to stay away from canned, precooked or
              packaged foods
            </p>
            <li>4. I buy precut fruits and vegetables to save time</li>
            <p>
              The convenience of cleaned precut fruits and vegetables may be
              tempting but that would not be a great idea. The precut foods may
              be contaminated depends on when and how its prepared
            </p>
            <li>
              5. I need superfood to compensate the nutritional requirement
            </li>
            <p>
              Human body does not require any superfoods such as protein. Some
              starch and meat contain more nutrition than super junk foods.
              Extremely active individuals should consider some modified diet
              plan within healthy foods
            </p>
            <li>6. I only consume poultry and milk</li>
            <p>
              They are mass produced in tightly built cages without a day of
              sunlight and fed long list of chemicals such as antibiotics.
              Therefore, it’s worth to choose local and organic at the premium
              price
            </p>
            <li>
              7. Everything is genetically modified these days so it does not
              matter
            </li>
            <p>
              Not all genetically modified food products are equally harmful to
              health. For an example, genetically modified banana does not pose
              the same level of threat as genetically modified salmon
            </p>
            <li>8. All food products meet or exceed government regulations</li>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, government agencies do not have the resources to
              enforce all the rules. Even if they do, it’s only minimum
              conditions. No long-term scientific studies done to support
              healthy consumptions
            </p>
            <li>9. I eat gluten free/ fat free diet</li>
            <p>
              Humans did not have gluten or obesity problem till the appearance
              of mass-produced processed foods. Facts can be stretched or even
              distorted to persuade an argument but that does not mean either
              one is right. Healthy lifestyle requires gluten and fat in our
              diet
            </p>
            <li>10. I eat healthy but can’t lose weight</li>
            <p>
              Eating healthy does not automatically lose weight. Since losing
              weight is an abnormal message to our natural health; it requires
              careful lifestyle considerations and commitment to achieve the
              desired results
            </p>
            <li>11. Healthy food is expensive</li>
            <p>
              Most healthy fresh foods are cheap. The organic meat and dairy
              products can be pricy but saving on the vegetables and fruits
              would compensate the difference
            </p>
            <li>12. I buy chips and pops on sale to save money</li>
            <p>
              The effort to save money overshadow the health issues of unhealthy
              food. Money is not the problem, but the welcoming attitude toward
              unhealthy food. A better alternative is to not to buy junk food in
              the first place
            </p>
            <li>13. Organic and non-GMO is the most nutritious foods</li>
            <p>
              Generally, they are better but not all products benefit from
              having the label. For an example, conventional avocadoes are just
              as safe and nutritious as any organic. Another slippery slope for
              consumers
            </p>
          </ol>
          <h2>Common Explanations & Recommendations</h2>
          <h3>Changing Lifestyle Habits</h3>
          <p>
            We must reorganize our priorities to lead healthier lifestyles.
            Ironically, we chase wealth at the expense of our health and then
            spend all to regain health. Some of us take pride in what we wear
            and what we drive but not enough concern about the food we consume
            on a regular basis. We do not have to live larger than life, we can
            choose to manage our life according to our means. For the most part,
            any traditional method of cooking would lead to many creative
            adventures on taste. Ability to cook is not just a skill to have but
            also an art. An ultimate way to live simply, happily and achieve
            better health.
          </p>
          <h3>Reading Beyond the Labels</h3>
          <p>
            The food labelling is far from perfect. From Genetically Modified
            (GM) or Genetically Engineered (GE) to Organic, labels are applied
            even on processed food products. Some labels go even further to say
            percentage of organic. Any such practices do not help the average
            consumer but only leaves confused. A good rule of thumb is to choose
            organic or GMO only where needed since the label comes with a
            significant cost compared to conventional products. Unfortunately,
            processed foods get new attention with the label displaying organic
            and GMO.
          </p>
          <h3>The Elephant in the Room</h3>
          <p>
            Lobbyists are interested in the procedural integrity of the food;
            however, the same group fails to dispute merchandise naming
            practices that deceits everyone. For an example, “Froot Loop” a
            popular breakfast cereal catered toward children; which is just as
            unhealthy as any candies. An effective naming strategy that exploits
            conventional wisdom of healthy fruits. Every loop is packed with
            processed carbohydrates, sugar, colourings and fortified nutrition
            without any healthy content of fruits. In a free society, government
            would always be challenged between consumer protection and corporate
            regulations. That means, consumers should not depend on any label to
            indicate whether is healthy or not.
          </p>
          <h3>Secret of Sustainable Diet</h3>
          <p>
            There are several types of diet programs available in the market
            today. Predominantly, the goal of any program is to lose weight and
            maintain good health. Of course, every diet proposal has its
            advantages and disadvantages; at same time, the success of any diet
            program depends on one’s commitment to the whole system. A critical
            component of any such platform is the underestimation of
            sustainability. The great finding in the lab do not always score
            great success in practice. For the purpose, a diet program must be
            simple, achievable and sustainable in the longer span of life time.
          </p>
          <h3>Emphasise Quality of Nutrition</h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to diet, the quality that matters not quantity. An
            important distinction is that amount of food and nutrition are not
            the same thing. In developing countries, lacking nutrition is due to
            not enough food source; however, in developed countries lacking
            nutrition is due to poor quality of food source. Regardless of
            amount of consumption, less nutrition in processed foods does not
            meet the health requirements. Body demands for nutrition and hunger
            returns; which is just a survival mechanism of a healthy body. Low
            quality of food triggers unexplained hungers; where overeating is
            the outcome diagnosed with eating disorders. Consuming quality
            nutrition in appropriate amount is the key to combat obesity.
          </p>
          <h3>Bring Back Mediterranean Diet</h3>
          <p>
            Popular diet programs such as Atkins diet, Paleo diet, zone diet,
            ketogenic diet, vegetarian diet, intermittent fasting, weigh-loss
            diet and raw food diet may not be the long-term solution. Depending
            on the circumstances, one may work better than other; nevertheless,
            just another fancy new thing to the market. The only diet
            extensively researched and proven over the centuries is the
            Mediterranean diet. People of Southern Europe demonstrated that the
            Mediterranean is not just diet but the way of life. The secret is to
            revisit the sustainable Mediterranean way of living that worked for
            centuries before trying something fancy.
          </p>
          <h3>Practice Fasting and Resting</h3>
          <p>
            The three meals a day practice is an evolved culture but not
            required. Realistically, the ideal is to eat two meals and two
            snacks in a 24-hour day to be healthy. As time progressed, people
            ate breakfast to avoid being hungry at work, then ate lunch usually
            at work followed by dinner with families at home. What works for
            lifestyle does not mean that is the right way of living a healthy
            life. Indeed, eating dinner before going to bed does more harm than
            good. Body is reprieved of rest due the food being digested
            throughout the sleep cycle. On the flip side, religions such as
            Hinduism and Islam promote fasting for better spiritual experience;
            which, ultimately improves concentration during prayers. Adapting to
            better dietary practice is the healthiest lifestyle anyone could
            accomplish in a lifetime.
          </p>
          <h3>Connect with Nature’s Rhythm</h3>
          <p>
            A day has 24 hours mechanical clock so does human body. Circadian
            rhythm is a biology clock integrated into every living thing which
            is activated by sun. The nature’s clock operates to slowdown, speed
            up and put on hold biological functions according the conditions of
            the environment. When sun rises, the nature predetermines all living
            things to be active and then rests when sun sets down. As per
            biology clock, breakfast and lunch is essential for body to produce
            energy during the day. Likewise, all meals will be efficiently
            utilized through the digestive system. However, eating dinner forces
            body to work overtime during the resting hours; which in turn
            stresses the internal organs. Ultimately, connecting with the
            natural rhythm is essential live a healthy life.
          </p>
          <h2>Future Directions</h2>
          <p>
            After conducting a multidimensional analysis on healthy lifestyle,
            we came to a consensus that the subject of physical, mental and
            social condition requires greater attention on the whole concept
            rather than laser beaming one discipline. Notably, most marketing
            agencies are ahead of the curve on persuasion campaigns. Consumer
            awareness is the key to making better choices. The difference
            between organic, GMO and conventional goods are over projected than
            reality. Certainly, organic would be an ideal choice of food but
            that is far from reality.The main perpetrator is the processed food;
            avoiding such products would return significant benefit to health.
            The wisdom is to buy raw food, not cooked products.
